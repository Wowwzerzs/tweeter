# Tweeter Project üê¶

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

## Features

Users can create short posts of up to 140 characters and have them append to the main page. Posts are sequential, with the most recent posts appearing at the top of the page. Tweeter fetches a list of posts from a simplified 'server' and allows users to add posts to this list dynamically. All requests are made asynchronously using the jQuery library.
